    <h2>Audrey Rentz</h2>
    <p>I am majoring in Computer Science- Functional Programming. </p>
    <p>I am an avid reader, wanna-be cowgirl, and a fan of the oxford comma... and run on sentences. I also love to bake. I have mastered macarons, made wedding cakes, and my buttercream frosting recipe is actually the best. I love a creative outlet, but never stick with one thing too long. My current project is embroidery.</p>
    <p>I am the fourth of six kids and have four adorable nieces. I have three cats. The first cat is a family pet, the second I adopted when I was 19, and the third cat I like to say was adopted by the second (He just brought her home one day and she stuck around.)</p>
    <p>This is my first semester at BYU-I, but so far I am enjoying my classes and the people in them. Everyone is very encouraging and supportive!</p>
